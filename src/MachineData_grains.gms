Note on the calculation of the costs:
The total cost = Capital recovery + IHT + Labor + Repairs + Fuel
AnnualInterest = Represent the annual payment you make for the purchase of the equipment
  = (Purchase price + salvage value)/2 * discount rate
The AnnualInterest therefore is in $/year and fixed payment for each year.
IHT = Annualized insurance, housing and taxed.
Although, this is also annualized (line AnnualInterest) it is also a function of the number of hours of operation which is a variable
in our model. Hence, the total expense due to IHT is calculated as a function of the total number of hours.

 The operating cost in the IBSAL data sheet consists of:
 Operating cost = (repairs + fuel/lube + labor + Operating interest + capital - AnnualInterest/AnnualUse)
   The last two terms in the calculation represent the capital recovery that is not covered by the AnnualInterest (i.e. which is a function
   of the number of hours that the machine is operated for).
 The datasheet in IBSAL thus reports three important parameters that should be used:
        AnnualInterest, IHT and OperatingCost
 Labor and fuel/lube is included or excluded depending on the machine. For example, baler does not include labor since it is hauled by the tractor
 and no human labor is required to bale. Hence one must be careful of including the tractor cost in the baler (and the tractor cost includes
 labor cost since you need someone to operater the tractor).

 Important Note: The calculations here, although based on the IBSAL datasheet, are modified a bit.
 The fuel consumption is calculated using the machine hp values and the Nebraska fuel consumption factor. The cost is calculated by using the
 fuel cost in $/gallon. However, the fuel cost can vary over time. Hence it is better to separate the fuel cost from the other operating
 costs calculated by IBSAL. Thus, the fuel consumption is calculated (using the Nebraska factor), but the actual cost is calculated as an
 independent value by using the current fuel cost (that is declared as a parameter in the model). The operating cost, therefore, considers
 all the categories mentioned above except the fuel cost.

 The Nebraska tractor function is:
 F = 0.06  P, where, P is the rated pto power in hp and F is the average gasoline consumption in gallons per hour.
 The ASABE standard specifies that a diesel tractor will use approximately 73% as much fuel in volume as a gasoline tractor.
 So for diesel fuel tractor, the relationship is: F = 0.73 * 0.06 * P
